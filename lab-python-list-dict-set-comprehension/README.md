   <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  </summary>

  This lab allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

  Upon completion of this exercise, you will be able to:
  
- Write concise and efficient code using list comprehension.
- Create dictionaries using dictionary comprehension.
- Use set comprehension to create sets with unique values.
- Apply conditional statements and loops within comprehension.
- Compare the readability and performance of comprehension vs traditional looping methods.
- Understand the limitations of comprehension and when it is appropriate to use it.

## Introduction

Welcome to the List, Dict, and Set Comprehension Lab!

In this lab, you will learn about list, dictionary, and set comprehensions in Python, which are concise ways of creating lists, dictionaries, and sets respectively, based on an existing iterable (such as a list or a range) and a set of conditions.

**This lab builds upon the solution from the previous exercise and enhances it by incorporating comprehension to create more robust and improved code.**

**Happy coding!** :heart:

## FAQs
<details>
  <summary>I am stuck in the exercise and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start.</summary>
  <br>

  If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear question about the specific issue you are facing. This will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.


  For example, is it a concept that you don't understand, or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources. 


  Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you will be able to start working toward the solution.

  <summary>I am unable to push changes to the repository. What should I do?</summary>
  <br>

There are a couple of possible reasons why you may be unable to *push* changes to a Git repository:

1. **You have not committed your changes:** Before you can push your changes to the repository, you need to commit them using the `git commit` command. Make sure you have committed your changes and try pushing again. To do this, run the following terminal commands from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push
  ```
2. **You do not have permission to push to the repository:** If you have cloned the repository directly from the main Ironhack repository without making a *Fork* first, you do not have write access to the repository.
To check which remote repository you have cloned, run the following terminal command from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
If the link shown is the same as the main Ironhack repository, you will need to fork the repository to your GitHub account first and then clone your fork to your local machine to be able to push the changes.

**Note**: You should make a copy of your local code to avoid losing it in the process.
