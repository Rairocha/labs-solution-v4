# Lab | Tableau

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Load and integrate datasets into Tableau for analysis.
- Differentiate between and appropriately assign measurements and dimensions within Tableau.
- Construct insightful barplots to compare categorical data.
- Design a treeplot to visualize hierarchical data.
- Synthesize cross tables to examine relationships between two categorical variables.
- Assemble a comprehensive dashboard that encapsulates multiple facets of the dataset.
- Save your Tableau workbook for future reference and sharing.

### Instructions

1. **Data Import**: Begin by loading the dataset `we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv` available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-bootcamp-v4/data/main/we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv) into Tableau.

2. **Gender Barplot**: Create a barplot to visualize the distribution of customers by **Gender**.

3. **Employment and Gender Barplot**: Construct a barplot that represents the number of customers by **EmploymentStatus** segmented by **Gender**.

4. **Measurements vs. Dimensions**: Review the **Measurements** and **Dimensions** identified by Tableau. Adjust them if necessary to ensure they match your data structure and analysis needs.

5. **Gender Barplot Sheet**: Develop a sheet dedicated to displaying the barplot of customer counts by **Gender**.

6. **Employment and Gender Barplot Sheet**: Prepare a separate sheet to showcase the barplot of customer counts by **EmploymentStatus** and **Gender**.

7. **State Treeplot Sheet**: Create a sheet with a treeplot (also known as a treemap) illustrating the number of customers in each **State**.

8. **Marital Status and Gender Cross Table**: Generate a cross table that breaks down the customers by Marital status and Gender.

9. **Dashboard Assembly**: Compile all the created sheets into a single, interactive dashboard for an integrated view of the data insights.

10. **Save Your Work**: Preserve your Tableau workbook by saving it as `tableau-lab.tbwx`.
